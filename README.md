 ECDI- A non-parametric copula interpolation with applications in a combustion process and climate data

==================================================================

 ECDI is the empirical copula displacement interpolation. Based on two samples (with uniform margins) from the same environment with only one different external factor $t$ (scaled to [0,1]), additional samples from the same environment are generated with $t \in (0,1)$.

Main programmes are:
ECDI2d - implemented for 2-dimensional parametric copula samples. 
ECDI3d - implemented for 3-dimensional samples.
